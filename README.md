## 💸 Who Am I?

I'm **EconomicSqueeze**, living proof that money may be imaginary, but financial stress is very real. Here, you'll find projects that tackle economics, finance, and tech—because if we can't fix the economy, we might as well code our way through it. 

📈 **Interests:**
- Economic data analysis 📊
- Stock market bots 📉
- FinTech experiments 💰
- Budgeting apps that try (and fail) to save my paycheck 🏦

## 🔥 What You'll Find Here

💻 **Cool Projects** – Automation, analytics, and maybe a bot that cries every time the market crashes.

🧐 **Deep Dives** – Exploring economic trends, because someone has to understand why eggs cost a fortune.

😂 **Memes** – Because humor is the only hedge against financial doom.

💀 Inflation is outpacing my WiFi speed, so I'm on a journey to:
- Build tools to make personal finance less painful
- Use AI to predict my next financial L
- Develop scripts that automate the grind
